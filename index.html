    <h1>My Most Precious Lucy!</h1>
    <p>My best pet is a white cute little chiwawa dog. Lucy likes beef and bones a lot</p>
    <p>Every evening I must take Lucy out for a walk as this is very healthy</p>
    <p>She is a brave and tough one, especially on visitors, so she must always be kept in her kennel</p>

    <h4>Lucy and Other People</h4>
    <p>Dogs are the best friend to man and so is Lucy...</p>
    <p>When left alone, she barks and complains a lot while making noise, but shows great <strong>joy</strong>when around people</p>
